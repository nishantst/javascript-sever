# 5 Features of VS Code:
 **1. Intellisense**
 >Intellisense is code auto-complete meets artificial intelligence.This utility provides a list of suggestions along with a short hint or description as we are writing codes.

 **2. CLI**
 >Similar to Sublime Text with its subl command line, Visual Studio Code is eqipped a CLI named code and it is easy to install in Windows,  the CLI will have already been installed along the app.

 **3. Peek**
 >While coding, we may often forget a particular function, where the function is intially defined, and what are the required parameters. With Peek, we can select a function then hit Shift+F12. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined.

 **4. Task Runner** 
 >Visual Studio Code also has a built in Task Runeer, which provides some level of convenience. To use this feature , we can either set a tasks.json file or through some popular Task configuration like Grunt, Gulp or MSBuild if provided. Once  the configuration is set we can run the Task Runner through the Command Palette by typing Run Task. Typing Task will list all related commands

 **5. Built-in Git**
 >Visual Studio Code has Git built right in the editor. On the left of the sidebar , we will find the Git icon where we can intialize Git as well as perform several Git commands such as commit, pull, push,rebase, publish, and look into the changes within the file. In addition if we are making changes on a Git repository, the Visual Studio will show color indicators in the code editor gutter, indicating where we have made the modifications.

# 8 Useful plugins of VS Code: 

**1. Import Cost**
>I. The Import Cost plugin for JavaScript and TypeScript allows us to be wary of any dependencies in real-time.Import Cost shows the size of a dependency inline when we are adding it to our code. It is a lightweight plugin that provides foresight and helps in efficient dependency management. The documentation lists down various import syntaxes for which this plugin shows the size of dependencies.

**2. File Utils**
>The File Utils extension enables you to perform file operations through the command palette.
we can bring up the command palette and select a file to perform simple file operations on it. we can duplicate (copy), move, delete, and rename a file, in addition to a basic folder related operations. It is a useful plugin that lets us manage our project files without leaving the confines of the visual studio.

**3. Project Manager**
>This extension helps us manage our Git, SVN, or Mercurial repositories as well. It further allows us to manage remote repositories too.In addition to the GUI based features, this extension adds commands to work with projects too. We can tweak the settings to further customize its features to our liking.

**4. SVG Viewer**
>SVG stands for scalable vector graphics, and SVG files are text files that store vector images for the web. If we open an SVG file in a text editor, it typically displays the textual content of these files. If we are working on editing these files directly, we may wish to view how such files are rendered by Visual Studio.The SVG Viewer plugin allows us to visualize SVG files, thereby saving us the time to use a different application to review our work. It essentially saves up time when we are working on making quick edits to SVG files.

**5. Code Spell Checker**
>A bulk of errors that developers get are often solved by correcting spelling mistakes in variable, function, and package names. Further, we may also make spelling errors while writing a comment, description, or documentation. This package helps in highlighting errors in our file. This package helps check our spellings in a variety of popular programming languages. We can also tweak a setting to make the code spell checker package work with specific file types.While it has support for English (US) and English (GB) when we install it, add on dictionaries are available for eight languages and medical terms. It makes a small, yet robust addition to our arsenal of best Visual Studio extensions.

**6. Remote — SSH**
>The Remote — SSH plugin by Microsoft allows us to connect to a remote development environment, which removes the need to have any code in our local system altogether. It also allows us to swap between multiple remote environments, letting us multitask between remote systems. Additionally, this plugin has support to connect to Linux, Windows, or macOS based remote systems. Development on remote servers is critical nowadays, making the Remote — SSH plugin an absolutely necessary Visual Studio extension.

**7. Debugger for Chrome**
> The Debugger for Chrome plugin integrates Visual Studio to Chrome or a Chromium-based browser that supports the Chrome Dev Tools Protocol.There are many debugging features that let us identify bugs in our code, without having to leave our IDE. In short, the Debugger for Chrome extension leads to a time-saving process in a commonly used debugging process.

**8. ESLint**
>ESLint is a static JavaScript code analyzer. It scans through our code and finds syntactical errors and inefficient programming practices. The ESlint Visual Studio extension integrates ESLint with our Visual Studio IDE to analyze our JavaScript code on demand. It requires ESLint to be installed locally or globally in our system, though.
